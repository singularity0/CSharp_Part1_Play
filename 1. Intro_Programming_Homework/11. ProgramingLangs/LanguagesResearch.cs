Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list with information about the most popular programming languages.How similar are they to C#? How do they differ from C#?
Write in a text file called “programming-languages.txt” at least five languages along with 2-3 sentences about each of them. Use English.

The IEEE mashed it all up to produce an interactive Web application for ranking the popularity of various languages. Here is the app’s overall top ten list as of July 2014:


Java
C
C++
Python
C#
PHP
Javascript
Ruby
R

 * C# vs JAVA
--------------

It is very abstract and hard task to compare a number of languages with C#. Every language has its own benefits and fit for use in its specific area. Will take just Java as the most popular langugage lately.
C# and Java

C# is a very good language if:

You want to do general purpose object oriented development. It's a classic, statically typed OOP language.
You are targeting Microsoft platforms only (it's worth remembering that Microsoft effectively cloned Java to create C# because they wanted a Java-like language that would lock people into Windows. They could have used Java, but that would have enabled people to easily run applications on other platforms....)
C# as a language is nicer than Java in various ways (better syntax for properties, value types, reified generics etc.). I prefer C# as a language to Java but in the grand scheme of things they are fairly similar languages and suitable for similar applications.

On the other hand, Java has some big advantages as well:
 * 
Huge open source ecosystem - the libraries for Java that you can get for free are by far the best of any language. It is hard to overstate the importance of this - from the point of getting things done, Java is very effective.
Tools - the Java tools are in my view better than what you can get the the .Net world. e.g. Maven (once you have mastered it!) is particularly impressive.
Maintainability - Java has been around a while and has been successful in big companies precisely because it is relatively stable and there has been a lot of effort put into backwards compatibility. The simple and slightly verbose syntax also helps Java here - it's easier to read and maintain code if the code is very clear and explicit.
New languages - The JVM has some amazing new languages (Scala, Clojure, Groovy etc.) that are the future of the Java platform. This is where much of the language innovation is happening, and it's happening much faster than in either Java or C#.
So Java vs. C# is a pretty close call and it really comes down to whether you want to be in the Microsoft camp or the Open Source / cross-platform camp.
Java because:
 
The library ecosystem is in my view much more important that the fact that C# has nicer syntax than Java
In the long run, I want all my code to be properly cross-platform and able to run on big clusters of cheap linux machines on the cloud.
Clojure is IMHO the most promising language in the world right now, and if I stick with the JVM platform I'll be able to transition my code and skills easily into Clojure over time.
